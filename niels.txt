Well, I woke up this morning,
Feelin' kind of blue,
My crops were lookin' sickly,
And I didn't know what to do.

Yellow rust disease, oh yellow rust disease,
You've taken all my wheat, and left me on my knees.

I worked hard all season,
Sowed my seeds with care,
But now my fields are barren,
And I'm left with despair.

Yellow rust disease, oh yellow rust disease,
You've taken all my wheat, and left me on my knees.

I tried all the remedies,
Sprayed my crops with love,
But nothing seemed to help,
As you spread from above.

Yellow rust disease, oh yellow rust disease,
You've taken all my wheat, and left me on my knees.
